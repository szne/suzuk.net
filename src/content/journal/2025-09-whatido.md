## What's this
**What I Do** is a closed diary app designed around the keyword *“Captured in time”*.  
You can post up to six times a day, and at the end of the day, AI automatically generates a summary of your moments.  
The interface changes with time — from sunrise to daytime, evening to night — using glassmorphism and glow effects to make time itself part of the experience.

## Technology used
- **React**: Core UI framework  
- **Vite**: Development bundler for speed  
- **Supabase**: Backend and database  

## Core Features
- **Post limit**: 6 per day  
- **Real-time clock display**  
- **AI-generated daily summaries**  

👉 Together, these create the unique experience of  
*"Six moments captured, one day summarized by AI."*

## Upcoming Features
- Light habit tracking (e.g., “Post 3 times every day this week”)  
- AI-powered reminders to build posting habits  
- Weekly & monthly AI summaries  
- Time-based themes (sunrise → day → sunset → night)

## Future Possibilities
- Close-friends sharing  
- Photo attachments (with storage considerations)  
- Contribution-graph style habit map
