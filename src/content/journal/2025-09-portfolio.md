## What's this
A tiny portfolio site that’s more like a digital bonsai: it doesn’t grow fast, but it keeps its charm as it changes little by little.

Think of it as a sandbox where I plant random ideas and watch them sprout (sometimes they die, but hey, that’s life).

## Technology used
- **Astro**: My main framework of choice. It’s like LEGO for the web.
- **CloudFlare Pages**: Free deployment, global edge, no excuses. The internet has never been this generous.

## Upcoming Features
- Rich Animation
- Enrich my journal
- Photo Gallery
