                <p>
                    Kohei Suzuki is a third-year Information Engineering student
                    at Tokyo University of Science, fascinated by machine
                    learning, data science, and financial engineering. He
                    prototypes faster than he finishes, and most of his trading
                    algorithms politely remind him that money is harder than
                    math.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He spends his time tinkering with AI-powered tools, building
                    bots that automate more than they should, and turning class
                    projects into half-serious research experiments. Deadlines
                    are his natural habitat — sometimes academic, sometimes
                    entrepreneurial.
                </p>
                <h2>Outside of work</h2>
                <p>
                    He’s part of the leadership team of a 110-member Yosakoi
                    dance club, where annual festival performances draw over
                    1,000 spectators. It’s less like coding and more like
                    debugging with drums and costumes. He enjoys driving,
                    traveling, and staring at maps while imagining new
                    infrastructures (roads deserve refactoring too).
                </p>
