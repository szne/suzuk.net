## What's this
A tiny site for my handle name, but also my sandbox for trying out Next.js (App Router).

## Technology used
- **Next.js (App Router)**: mostly for page generation  
- **Vercel**: free & easy deploy  
- **react-markdown + gray-matter**: to turn markdown into pages  
- **GSAP / mekuri**: small page transitions

## Notes
Motion logo, dark mode, random 404 messages… I just kept adding little touches until it felt fun.  
Honestly, probably didn’t need Next.js here, but it made things smoother than raw React.
