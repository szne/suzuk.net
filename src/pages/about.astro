        <h2>About</h1>
        <p>
            Kohei Suzuki is a third-year Information Engineering student at
            Tokyo University of Science, fascinated by machine learning, data
            science, and financial engineering. He prototypes faster than he
            finishes, and most of his trading algorithms politely remind him
            that money is harder than math.
        </p>
        <p>
            He spends his time tinkering with AI-powered tools, building bots
            that automate more than they should, and turning class projects into
            half-serious research experiments. Deadlines are his natural habitat
            — sometimes academic, sometimes entrepreneurial.
        </p>
        <h2>Outside of work</h2>
        <p>
            He’s part of the leadership team of a 100-member Yosakoi dance club,
            where annual festival performances draw over 1,000 spectators. It’s
            less like coding and more like debugging with "naruko" and costumes. He
            enjoys driving, traveling, and staring at maps while imagining new
            infrastructures (roads deserve refactoring too).
        </p>
